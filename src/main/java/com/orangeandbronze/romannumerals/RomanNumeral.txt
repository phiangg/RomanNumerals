This is a Java class called "RomanNumeralCoverter" that has a method named "intToRoman" for converting an integer to its corresponding Roman numeral representation.

The "intToRoman" method taks an integer "num" as an input and returns a string representing the Roman numeral equivalent of "num".

The method defines 2 ar9rays called "symbols" and "values". These arrays define the Roman numeral symbolds and their corresponding integer values. (e.g. "X" reperesents the value 10).

The method then uses a (for) loop to iterate through the "symbols" and "values" arrays. For each element in the arrays, the loop checks if the current value of "num" is greater than
or equal to the current value in the "values" array. If it is, the corresponding symbol from the "symbols" array is appended to a "StringBuilder" object called "builder", and the
current value in the "values" array. This process continues until "num" has been reduced to zero.

Finally, the method returns the "builder" object as a string using the "toString" method.
